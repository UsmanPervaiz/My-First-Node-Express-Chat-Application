# My-First-Node-Express-Chat-Application

This is a real-time chat application using Socket.io, Node.js and Express.

Socket.io gives us the way to have real-time 2 way communication between server and clients and this is done through a TCP socket.

In order for anyone to clone this repository please follow the steps below:

> * **Create a new directory/folder and make sure you are inside this new directory/folder that you just created.**
> * **Git clone this repository into the new directory/folder.**
> * **If you do not already have Nodemon installed, in your terminal run "npm install -g nodemon".**
> * **Next in your terminal run "npm install".**
> * **To run the application simply type "npm start" and hit "enter".**

There is nothing fancy, as this is my first Node.js and Express app. The main goal was to learn the basics and to learn how to communicate between the server and the client.

The usernames are unique and you cannot login using a username that is already in the chat. The user will be notified if this is the case. Login data is not being saved anywhere on the server, it is a simple select a username and start chatting.
